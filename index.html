      I'm passionate about working with textual data to uncover patterns, extract meaningful insights, and explore how language shapes economic narratives. 
      Currently, my research focuses on central bank communicationsâ€”analyzing their textual complexity to better understand how clarity, tone, and textual structure 
      influenced by the market.
